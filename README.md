# auto1point3Acres

## Summary

An automated script to get not only daily rewards but also able to answer daily questions in 1point3auto (一亩三分地). Pytesseract is used to crack the captcha, and Heroku is used for auto deployment.

## Deployment

### Step1: create your Heroku app

Click the `Deploy to Heroku` Button below, this will take you to a website that helps you set up an Heroku app, (you need to create an account first if you don't have one)

### All set

Now your Heroku app will follow the schedule you just set and execute the script that gets all daily rewards!

## (Optional) Manually run the script

### First way: using Heroku console

1. Go to your Heroku app page. (Can be accessed if you log in to your Heroku account).
2. At top right of the page, click `More` > `Run console`.
3. Now you should have console opened, input `bash` and click `Run`.
4. Wait until the console logged, then run the command `python main.py`.

### Second way: run the Heroku app locally

**NOTE**: Before using any command, make sure you have installed and login to Heroku, the instruction can be found in [install Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

```code
Heroku login
Heroku run main --app <YOUR_APP_NAME>
```

## TODO

- [ ] Fix unable to crack captcha for daily questions(should be zooming issus)
- [ ] Add total awards information display support

## Credit

- [1p3a_python_script](https://github.com/VividLau/1p3a_python_script)

The code is forked from this project, which automated the process of login to 1point3acres and gets the daily reward. One thing to point out is that it uses `pytesseract` for authentication code recognition, which makes it fully automated.

- [1point3auto](https://github.com/CryoliteZ/1point3auto)

I followed this project's idea and instructions to deploy the script to Heroku, which simplified the deployment to almost one click.
